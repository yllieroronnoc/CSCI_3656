    Description:
        Q1: created vector containing 11 equally spaced points that cover
        the interval [0,1] using linspace(x,y,n). Linspace will generate n
        points covering x->y.
        Q2: using matlab matrix math, y was computed with each individual
        element in x.
        Q3: made a nice plot of x vs. y
        Q4:
